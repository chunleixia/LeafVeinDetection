## Results by Proposed method and Faster R-CNN

The detection reuslts are grouped according to the 4 types of leaves in the leaf image dataset.  

The detection results by our proposed method is packed in Proposed.zip file.  
The detected main skeleton are drwan in black lines and numbered in blue digits.  
The direction of each leaf is marked by the read arrows.  
An example is given in the follow figure.

The detection results by Faster R-CNN is packed in Faster_RCNN.zip file.  
The detected individual leaves are marked by the blue bounding boxes.
